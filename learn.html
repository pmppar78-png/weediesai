      <!-- Origins & History -->
      <article class="learn-card">
        <h2>Origins &amp; History</h2>
        <p>Cannabis is one of the oldest cultivated plants, with evidence of use dating back thousands of years across multiple continents.</p>
        <h3>Where It Originated</h3>
        <p>Most researchers believe cannabis originated in Central Asia, likely in the regions around modern-day Mongolia and southern Siberia. From there, it spread along ancient trade routes to other parts of the world.</p>
        <h3>Historical Uses</h3>
        <p>Throughout history, cannabis has been used for a variety of purposes including fiber production (hemp), food (seeds), and in traditional practices. Different cultures incorporated the plant in various ways based on their specific needs and customs.</p>
      </article>

      <!-- The Plant & Compounds -->
      <article class="learn-card">
        <h2>The Plant &amp; Compounds</h2>
        <p>Cannabis contains over 100 different compounds called cannabinoids, along with aromatic compounds called terpenes.</p>
        <h3>THC vs CBD</h3>
        <p><strong>THC (tetrahydrocannabinol)</strong> is the primary compound associated with the intoxicating effects of cannabis. It interacts with receptors in the brain and body.</p>
        <p><strong>CBD (cannabidiol)</strong> is another major cannabinoid that does not produce intoxicating effects on its own. Many people are interested in CBD for various reasons, and research into its properties is ongoing.</p>
        <h3>Terpenes Overview</h3>
        <p>Terpenes are aromatic compounds found in many plants, including cannabis. They contribute to the distinct smells and flavors of different cannabis varieties. Common terpenes include myrcene, limonene, pinene, and linalool. Some believe terpenes may influence the overall experience, though research continues.</p>

      <!-- Medical Use -->
      <article class="learn-card">
        <h2>Medical Use</h2>
        <p>"Medical cannabis" refers to the use of cannabis or its components under the guidance of a healthcare provider, typically in jurisdictions where such use is permitted by law.</p>
        <p>Some people report using cannabis to help manage various conditions. However, individual experiences vary widely, and what works for one person may not work for another.</p>
        <p>Research into potential therapeutic applications of cannabis and cannabinoids is ongoing. Scientists continue to study how these compounds interact with the body's systems.</p>
        <p><strong>Important:</strong> This information is not medical advice. If you're considering cannabis for any health-related purpose, consult with a qualified healthcare professional who can evaluate your specific situation.</p>
      </article>

      <!-- Responsible Use & Safety -->
      <article class="learn-card">
        <h2>Responsible Use &amp; Safety</h2>
        <p>If you choose to use cannabis where it is legal, consider these safety guidelines:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Never drive impaired.</strong> Cannabis can affect coordination, reaction time, and judgment. Always arrange safe transportation.</li>
          <li><strong>Keep away from children and pets.</strong> Store all cannabis products securely and out of reach.</li>
          <li><strong>Avoid mixing with alcohol</strong> or other substances, as this can intensify effects unpredictably.</li>
          <li><strong>Start low, go slow.</strong> If you're new to cannabis or trying a new product, begin with a small amount and wait to understand how it affects you before considering more.</li>
          <li><strong>Know your source.</strong> Purchase from licensed, regulated sources where available to ensure product safety and accurate labeling.</li>
        </ul>
      </article>

      <!-- Misuse & Overuse -->
      <article class="learn-card">
        <h2>Misuse &amp; Overuse</h2>
        <p>Like many substances, cannabis can be overused. Being aware of your patterns can help maintain a healthy relationship with cannabis.</p>
        <h3>Signs of Overuse</h3>
        <p>Some general signs that use may be becoming problematic include: needing increasing amounts for the same effect, difficulty cutting back despite wanting to, neglecting responsibilities, or experiencing negative impacts on relationships, work, or daily life.</p>
        <h3>Taking Breaks &amp; Moderation</h3>
        <p>Some people find it helpful to take periodic breaks from cannabis use. This can help reset tolerance and provide perspective on how cannabis fits into their life.</p>
        <h3>When to Seek Help</h3>
        <p>If you feel your cannabis use is negatively affecting your life and you're having trouble changing your habits on your own, consider reaching out to a healthcare provider, counselor, or support group. Seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness.</p>

    <section class="faq-section">
      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
      <div class="faq-grid">
        <article class="faq-item">
          <h3>How long do effects last?</h3>
          <p>Effects vary based on the method of consumption, individual factors, and the specific product. Inhaled cannabis typically produces effects within minutes that may last 1-3 hours. Edibles can take 30 minutes to 2 hours to take effect and may last 4-8 hours or longer.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="faq-item">
          <h3>What's the difference between THC and CBD?</h3>
          <p>THC is the primary intoxicating compound in cannabis. CBD is non-intoxicating and is being studied for various potential properties. Both interact with the body's endocannabinoid system but in different ways.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="faq-item">
          <h3>What is tolerance?</h3>
          <p>Tolerance occurs when your body adapts to a substance, requiring more to achieve the same effects. Regular cannabis users may develop tolerance over time. Taking breaks can help reduce tolerance.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="faq-item">
          <h3>Can cannabis be habit-forming?</h3>
          <p>Yes, some people can develop a dependence on cannabis. Research suggests about 9% of users may develop what's called cannabis use disorder. Risk factors include frequency of use, age of first use, and individual susceptibility.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="faq-item">
          <h3>Why do edibles feel different?</h3>
          <p>When cannabis is eaten, THC is processed by the liver and converted into a different compound (11-hydroxy-THC) that may produce stronger and longer-lasting effects. This is why edibles can feel more intense than inhaled cannabis.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="faq-item">
          <h3>What does "set and setting" mean?</h3>
          <p>"Set" refers to your mindset—your mood, expectations, and mental state. "Setting" refers to your environment—where you are and who you're with. Both can significantly influence your experience with cannabis.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="faq-item">
          <h3>What are indica and sativa?</h3>
          <p>Traditionally, indica and sativa referred to different cannabis plant types with supposedly different effects. However, modern research suggests the effects depend more on the specific cannabinoid and terpene profile than the plant classification.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="faq-item">
          <h3>How should cannabis be stored?</h3>
          <p>Store cannabis in a cool, dark place in an airtight container. Keep it away from heat, light, and moisture to maintain quality. Most importantly, store it securely away from children and pets.</p>
