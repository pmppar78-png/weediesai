Netlify AI / Claude – IMPORTANT ENGINE INSTRUCTIONS

This site ALREADY has a fully wired AI backend. Do NOT break it.

Engine:
- Netlify Function: netlify/functions/ai-chat.js
- Public endpoint:  /api/ai-chat   (see netlify.toml and _redirects)
- Frontend chat JS: assets/js/chat.js
- AI pages:
    • strain-ai.html  (<body data-ai-mode="strain">)
    • grow-ai.html    (<body data-ai-mode="grow">)

DO NOT:
- Delete, rename, or move netlify/functions/ai-chat.js

YOU MAY:
- Edit copy, layout, and styling (HTML/CSS)

        </ul>

        <h3>Potential Side-Effects</h3>

        <p>Strain Finder AI can warn you about strains more likely to cause unwanted effects and suggest gentler alternatives:</p>

        <ul class="leaf-list">
          <li><strong>Anxiety &amp; paranoia</strong> – some high-THC sativas can feel "racy" or overwhelming. It knows which to avoid.</li>
          <li><strong>Dry mouth &amp; dry eyes</strong> – common across most strains, but some are worse than others.</li>
          <li><strong>Heavy tiredness</strong> – certain indicas will knock you out. It can steer you toward functional options.</li>
          <li><strong>Dizziness or disorientation</strong> – some strains hit harder than expected. It helps you find smoother experiences.</li>
          <li><strong>Increased heart rate</strong> – certain strains affect some users more. It can suggest calmer alternatives.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>You can also ask:</p>

        <ul class="leaf-list">
          <li>"Which strains are less likely to make me paranoid?"</li>
          <li>"What strain gives giggly, social energy without being too intense?"</li>
          <li>"What should I avoid if I'm prone to anxiety?"</li>
          <li>"Recommend a mellow edible for sleep and explain how much to start with."</li>
          <li>"Compare Blue Dream vs. Green Crack for daytime use."</li>
          <li>"What's a good strain for creativity that won't make me too spacey?"</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Edibles Expertise</h3>

        <p>Strain Finder AI has deep knowledge of cannabis edibles — how they work, how they differ from smoking or vaping, and how to approach them safely:</p>

        <ul class="leaf-list">
          <li><strong>Types of edibles</strong> – gummies, chocolates, baked goods, hard candies, beverages, tinctures, capsules, mints, and more. Each has its own onset profile.</li>
          <li><strong>Onset time</strong> – unlike smoking, edibles take 30–90 minutes to kick in (sometimes longer). It explains why patience is critical.</li>
          <li><strong>Peak effects</strong> – edibles typically peak 2–3 hours after consumption, with effects building gradually.</li>
          <li><strong>Total duration</strong> – expect 4–8 hours total, sometimes longer. Plan accordingly and don't have obligations during this window.</li>
          <li><strong>Why edibles feel stronger</strong> – when THC is digested, your liver converts it to 11-hydroxy-THC, which crosses the blood-brain barrier more effectively and creates a more intense, body-focused experience.</li>
          <li><strong>Beginner dosing guidance</strong> – educational info on starting low (2.5–5mg THC for new users), waiting at least 2 hours before considering more, and building tolerance slowly.</li>
          <li><strong>Safety reminders</strong> – start low, don't redose too quickly, avoid mixing with alcohol, stay hydrated, and have a safe space ready.</li>
          <li><strong>Edibles vs. smoking/vaping</strong> – edibles produce longer-lasting, more body-heavy effects compared to the faster, shorter experience of inhalation.</li>
          <li><strong>Matching edible profiles to strain effects</strong> – many edibles are labeled by strain or effect profile (indica, sativa, hybrid). It can help you choose the right one for your goals.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Common edibles questions you can ask:</p>

        <ul class="leaf-list">
          <li>"How much should a beginner take for a gummy?"</li>
          <li>"Why do edibles hit harder than smoking?"</li>
          <li>"What's a good edible dose for sleep?"</li>
          <li>"How long until this edible kicks in?"</li>
          <li>"I took an edible an hour ago and don't feel anything — should I take more?"</li>
        </ul>
