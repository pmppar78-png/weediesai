Netlify AI / Claude – IMPORTANT ENGINE INSTRUCTIONS

This site ALREADY has a fully wired AI backend. Do NOT break it.

Engine:
- Netlify Function: netlify/functions/ai-chat.js
- Public endpoint:  /api/ai-chat   (see netlify.toml and _redirects)
- Frontend chat JS: assets/js/chat.js
- AI pages:
    • strain-ai.html  (<body data-ai-mode="strain">)
    • grow-ai.html    (<body data-ai-mode="grow">)

DO NOT:
- Delete, rename, or move netlify/functions/ai-chat.js
- Remove or change the /api/ai-chat redirect
- Remove the <script src="assets/js/chat.js"> on AI pages

YOU MAY:
- Edit copy, layout, and styling (HTML/CSS)
- Add non-conflicting snippets (analytics, ads) AFTER the engine is confirmed working
- Add new sections, tabs, pages, or imagery

Always keep the /api/ai-chat endpoint working and the existing file/folder structure intact.
